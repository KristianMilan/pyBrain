# **pyBrain**

Brief description
====
This project is an example of Artificial Intelligence implementation.
It is based on personal studies about psicology and personal inspiration.
I've not knowledge about the actually proven AI technologies.

The basic idea: 
Considering a set of binary inputs, and a set of binary outputs, we have to create a data structure that for each combinations on inputs can relate all the outputs combinations.

This data structure must allow to be *modeled* in order to change, for a given input, the best outputs combinations.

input mem

output mem
